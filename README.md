## Introduction
<strong>An asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.</strong>


## Installation 
This app runs on a Node.js environment, so ensure you have a Node installed on your machine. To do this, you can open the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the command (by doing this, you will be able to check which version you have if so):
```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, please follow the link with the instructions:

* secure API key 
Please note that this app aims to learn how the API and client/server scripts work together. Because of the purpose of learning - the API key might be exposed on the client side. That's not recommended to do in a production environment.
